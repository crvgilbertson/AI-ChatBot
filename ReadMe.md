This is a basic chatbot built using tflear and tensorflow and tflearn.

CD into the directory and run python main.py to start the application. (Must be using Python 3)

You will then be able to chat with the bot. Currently the bot only uses the algorithm to calculate 5 potential questions 
based on your input. This will be updated in future to account
for more questions and responses. I might even try to automate the process myself. 


Either way, you may add more questions/responses in the intents.json file. just be sure to delete all
files apart from the json and py files before re-training on your new data.

Enjoy!
